OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
------------------
Grade: A-
Status: Production-ready with minor improvements

STRENGTHS:
- ✓ Clean architecture
- ✓ Good test coverage (70%)
- ✓ Thread-safe design
- ✓ Security clean (0 vulnerabilities)
- ✓ Already optimized

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:

- Performance optimizations (FPS, memory)
- UI error handling
- Missing features (multi-track, presets, etc.)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review analysis documents
2. Prioritize v1.1 tasks
3. Implement test coverage
4. Apply Raspberry Pi optimizations
5. Plan v1.2 feature development
